Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

## Developing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and `node`.

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Our libraries:

- [svelte-maplibre](https://github.com/dimfeld/svelte-maplibre)

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
